• Created web application using Flask that implements a machine learning model to predict reviews.
• App predicts inputted review as positive or negative and also gives prediction probability.
• Model learns from user feedback who can classify the review prediction as correct or incorrect.
• Model implemented using a Hashing Vectorizer and Logistic Regression Classifier in Python.

Implementation of the app can be found at https://mominkhan.pythonanywhere.com

The code for the trained model can be found in the file modelbeforepickledump.ipynb
